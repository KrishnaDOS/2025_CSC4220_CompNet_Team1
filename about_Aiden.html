        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home IOT Vulnerability Scanner, & VPN Server: </strong> Developed a user friendly IOT Vulnerability Scanner and threat notification system to identify misconfigurations in the user's WLAN and recommend fixes as well as send out threat landscape reports. Utilized networking tools Burpsuite and nmap to craft custom .json requests for handling Nessus output files. The project utilized Nessus Vulnerability scanner, Wireguard VPN, Shodan, and Python to create a fully configurable system as well as creating an in-depth tutorial to allow for non-tech-literate users to successfully implement it on their own network.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Track It — Package Tracking Web Application: </strong> Worked as project coordinator and developer in a team of 6 to deploy a custom parcel tracking system and web server that allows for universal compatibility with various online shops and shipping companies such as Amazon, Etsy, USPS etc. The system utilized APIs from various shipping services to display real-time tracking information as well as using Python SMTP to send package updates to users. User account information was stored on a MySQL database which allowed for simultaneous tracking of multiple packages.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Custom DNS Server for Content Moderation & Ad Blocking: </strong> Set up a home DNS Server utilizing a Raspberry Pi to allow for content moderation for home network traffic, and Ad/Malware blocking. Utilized unbound to direct unknown DNS request to Top Level Domain servers instead of routing through ISP’s DNS resolvers, increasing privacy. DNS server allows for domain blocking which prevents connections to malicious sites as well as ensuring advertising domains are unable to be resolved.</li>
